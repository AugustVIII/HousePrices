# Data analysis and implementation of ML models
- Data set - [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Models training: Lasso, Enet, XGboost, LGBM
- Hyperparameters tuning with a help of GridSearch, Optuna
- Feature analysis with a 'Feature importances' and 'Permutation importances'
- Clustering with a KMeans algorithm and dimension reduction techniques: PCA, t-SNE and UMAP
- Best result was achieved with a blending model: __246th__ place out of __5347__ with a RMSLE metric __0.11978__
